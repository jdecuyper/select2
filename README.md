Select2 - display currently selected value
==========================================

The select2 control does not display the currently selected value which in some case is a problem as the user may want
to easily copy & paste the value to another program or may want to start a new search and use the current value as a 
starting point.

Feature only affects the select2 control of type `single`.

Branch is based on following SHA: [1e9cfc762f](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/tree/1e9cfc762fcdcc88c3bc905bd026047cd96746c3)
